# Bamazon

Requires a keys.js file to run.  Should be formatted as follows:

```javascript
exports.connection = {
	host: 'localhost',
	port: 3306,
	user: 'root',
	password: 'password',
	database: 'bamazon'
};
```

You will also need to run "npm install" to get the right packages from the package.json
